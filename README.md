# Lending-Club-Capstone
NYC DSA Capstone project

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that can predict loan defaults in order to help investors optimize their portfolio. The data analysis is in Capstone.ipynb. Capstone.ipynb also includes some initial work with tree-based models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree. It also includes Support Vector Machines.

The Debugging_Models.ipynb has more on the tree-based models and Support Vector Machines becuase they were not yielding the results I initially desired or expected. The best model I came up with is in the NeuralNetwork.ipynb.

Here is a link to the blog post where the project: https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/machine-learning/a-machine-learning-approach-to-predicting-loan-defaults/
